GemPy Project
Welcome to the official repository for GemPy - an open-source, Python-based 3D geological modeling library. Designed for researchers, geologists, and software developers, GemPy enables you to model complex geological structures and integrate various types of geological data in a consistent framework.

Features
3D Geological Modeling: Create detailed geological models that can be visualized and analyzed in three dimensions.
Interoperability: Seamlessly integrates with other Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, and supports GIS data formats.
Versatile Data Integration: Incorporate various data types, including stratigraphic, structural, and geophysical data.
Stochastic Modeling: Generate multiple realizations of your geological model to assess uncertainty and variability in geological interpretations.
Getting Started
To get started with GemPy, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/gempy-project/gempy.git
cd gempy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Hereâ€™s a simple example to create your first model:

python
Copy code
import gempy as gp

# Code to create a basic model
model = gp.create_model('Example_Model')
# Add more model setup code here
For more detailed tutorials and examples, check out our documentation.
